Wirte a REST API in python with flask 
It should have following 6 endpoints
1. GET /todos → Retrieve all tasks
2. GET /todos/{id} → Retrieve a specific task
3. POST /todos → Create a new task
4. PUT /todos/{id} → Update a task
5. DELETE /todos/{id} → Delete a task
6. A swagger doc serving endpoint 
It should save all the tasks in local squlite database file
There should be swagger metadata for each endpoint so that dynamic swagger documentation can be generated
We also want a Makefile with various useful targets including a help target which will display help for each target
make run should first generate the swagger doc and then run the program
Please make sure the program is split into smaller, easy to understand (at a first glance) modules.
Please also include unit tests as well.
Please add appropriate logging
